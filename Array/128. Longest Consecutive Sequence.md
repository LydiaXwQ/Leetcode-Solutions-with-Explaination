## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

#### Question:

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.



#### Approach 1: Brute Force

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int count = 1;
        int max = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                if(nums[i] == nums[i - 1] + 1) {
                    count++;
                    if(count > max) {
                        max = count;
                    }
                } else {
                    count = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
       
    }
}
```

**Reflection:**

Some Edge Cases need to think about:

1. Empty array should return 0

2. Duplicate might exist:

   i.e [1,2,0,1] sorted -> [0, 1, 1, 2]

   length of the max sequence should be 3 (0, 1, 2) rather than 2.

Time Complexity: **`O(n log n)`** Note that this approach cannot fulfill the question time requirement of O(n).



#### Approach 2: Using Set

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        //Create a set and add all nums to it
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int num : nums) {
            set.add(num);
        }

        int max = 0;
        //As we know every start of a sequence doesn't have a number to its left:
        for(int num : nums) {
            //if set doesnt contain num - 1 meaning num is the start of a sequence
            if(!set.contains(num - 1)) {
                int count = 1;
                while(set.contains(num + 1)) {
                    count++;
                    num++;
                    
                }
                if(count > max) {
                    max = count;
                }
                
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

**Reflection:** 

1. add all numbers into the set

2. find out the start number of the sequence:

   a) check if num - 1 exists in the set.

3. After finding out the start, then count the length of the sequence by checking if the num + 1 exists in the map while also update the max.

Visualization:

Take [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2] as an example:

1. 0 doesn't exist in the sequence, so 1 is the start.
2. Start from 1, check if num + 1 exist in the set (if 2, 3, 4...) in the set.

Time complexity is **`O(n)`** and Space complexity is also **`O(n`**) (taken n spots by construction of the set)

Note that while there's a nested loop in the code, but time complexity is still O(n), this is because we don't enter the loop for every number, we only enter where it is the start of a sequence. Each number in the array is processed at most twice (once in the `for` loop and possibly once in the `while` loop), regardless of the size of the input. Thus, the time complexity remains O(n), where n is the length of the array.

## 1. Two Sum

#### Question

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly\* one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

#### Approach 1: Brute Force

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] arr = new int[2];
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for(int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if(nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    arr[0] = i;
                    arr[1] = j;
                }
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```

**Reflection:** 

The time complexity is **`O(n^2)`,** and it iterate through the whole list and sum up all pairs to find the valid pairs. 



#### Approach 2: HashMap (Two-pass)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> former = new HashMap<>();
        int[] arr = new int[2];
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(!former.containsKey(nums[i])) {
                former.put(nums[i], i);
            }
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(former.containsKey(target - nums[i]) && former.get(target - nums[i]) != i) {
                arr[0] = former.get(target - nums[i]);
                arr[1] = i;
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```

**Reflection:**

The first iteration used to initialize the HashMap, with the key is the element, and value is its corresponding position. Then second iteration iterate through the array to find if the complement exists in the map, if so, meaning there is a complement exists in the array. Otherwise no.

There's an **edge case** needs to pay attention to this approach:

When meet a case like this: **`[2,4,11,3]`** index returned should be 0, 1 rather than 3, 3

When we are initializing the map, we alr store 3 into the map. So in the second pass, we'll misreturn 3 as the complement of 3, which is incorrect.

To avoid this, we need to also check out the index: `former.get(target - nums[i]) != i`

Which is the complement's index cannot be the same as the number's index.

Time complexity is **`O(n)`**, as the hashmap operations take constant time, and we only use two seprate for-loops in the code.



#### Approach 3: HashMap (One-pass) --> Store the num

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> former = new HashMap<>();
        int[] arr = new int[2];
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if(!former.containsKey(complement)) {
                former.put(nums[i], i);
            } else {
                arr[0] = i;
                arr[1] = former.get(complement);
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```

**Reflection:**

Iterate through the array to check if there's complement exists in the hashMap. If haven't find the complement yet, store the num and its index for future search. If in the future search, the complement shows up, meaning its parter alr stored in map, then update and return the map. Otherwise, return an empty array.

Time complexity is **`O(n)`**



#### Approach 4: HashMap(One-pass) --> Store the complement

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> former = new HashMap<>();
        int[] arr = new int[2];
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            if(!former.containsKey(complement)) {
                former.put(complement, i);
            } 
            if (former.containsKey(nums[i]) && i != former.get(nums[i])){
                arr[0] = i;
                arr[1] = former.get(nums[i]);
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```

Stores the complement while iterating through the array:

[2,4,11,3]

Meet 2: stores 4 and 0

In future search, we found 2's complement which is 4 in the map,

so we update the result array and return it.

The edge case still exists, that's why we need to have the additional AND check:
**`i != former.get(nums[i])`**

The runtime complexity is also **`O(n)`**

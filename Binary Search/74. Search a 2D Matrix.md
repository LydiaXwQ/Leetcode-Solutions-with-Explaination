## 74. Search a 2D Matrix

#### Question:

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` *if* `target` *is in* `matrix` *or* `false` *otherwise*.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.



#### Approach 1: Two Binary Search

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int row = matrix.length;
        int col = matrix[0].length;
        int top = 0;
        int bottom = row - 1;
        //Binary Search on cols
        while(top <= bottom) {
            int mid = top + ((bottom - top) / 2);
            if(target < matrix[mid][0]) {
                bottom = mid - 1;
            } else if(target > matrix[mid][col - 1]) {
                top = mid + 1;
            } else {
                return binarySearch(matrix[mid], target);
            }
        }
      
      	//handle the case when there's only one element: i.e [[1]]
        return false;
    }
		
  	//Binary Search on the row
    public boolean binarySearch(int[] row, int target) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = row.length - 1;
        while(l <= r) {
            int mid = l + ((r - l) / 2);
            if(row[mid] < target) {
                l = mid + 1;
            } else if(row[mid] > target) {
                r = mid - 1;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Reflection:**

We can utilize the trait of the second property given in the problem: "The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row."

By this property, we are able to use the binary search on cols. 

For example, if matrix = [ [1,3,5,7],

​											[10,11,16,20],

​											[23,30,34,60] ], 

and target = 3.

We first initialize a `top pointer = 0` (point to the first row), and a `bottom pointer = matrix.length - 1` (point to the last row), and mid will be the `middle row = top + ((bottom - top) / 2)`;

Then, if `target < matrix[mid] [0]` (target value < smallest value(left-most) on the middle row), then move the bottom pointer up (as we want to find the row with elements smaller than the middle one)

else if `target > matrix[mid] [col - 1]` (target value > largest value (right-most) on the middle row), then move the top pointer down.

else, target is within the mid row (`matrix[mid] [0] < target < matrix[mid] [col - 1]`), we do the binary search on that row, return true if we found the target, false otherwise.

**Side note to myself:**

The `return false` outside of the while loop handle the case when there's only one element: **i.e [[1]], target = 0**. As the binary search on the cols will make bottom moves over the top, and top stays at index 0 (top and bottom pointer crossed out), meaning it can't find the target in the first binary search. Thus, should return false.

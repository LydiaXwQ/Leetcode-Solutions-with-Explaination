## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

#### Question:

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`



#### Approach 1: Binary Search

```java
class Solution {

    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length - 1;

        while (l <= r) {
            if (nums[l] <= nums[r]) {
                return nums[l];
            }

            int mid = (l + r) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] >= nums[l]) {
                l = mid + 1;
            } else {
                r = mid;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

**Reflection:**

If the mid is bigger than the left-most num, then it means it is in the left sorted portion, then we need to search to the right (l = mid + 1)

If the mid is smaller than the left-most num, then it means it is in the right sorted portion, then we need to search to the left (r = mid). The reason why r = mid not r = mid - 1 is because num[mid] might possibly be the smallest one in the array. 我们需要再查一下mid的num，所以设r = mid.

## 704. Binary Search

#### Question: 

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

#### Approach 1: Binary Search

```java
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = nums.length - 1;
        
        while(l <= r) {
            int mid = l + ((r - l) / 2);
            if(nums[mid] < target) {
                l = mid + 1;
            } else if(nums[mid] > target) {
                r = mid - 1;
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

**The reason of why l <= r is:**

Consider nums[] is [5], and target is 6.

And when l = r = 0, we should still run the while loop, since we haven't evaluate nums[0] yet.

After a run in while loop, now l = 1, r = 0 since 5 < 6. This time, we can safely return -1 since we've already examine all the numbers in the array.

Thus, l = r means we haven't examine that single element yet, only when l and r are crossed ( l <= r ), it means we've examined that element already.

Time complexity is **`O(log n)`**since everytime we half off the array.

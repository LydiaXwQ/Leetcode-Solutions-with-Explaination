## 875. Koko Eating Bananas

#### Question:

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return *the minimum integer* `k` *such that she can eat all the bananas within* `h` *hours*.



#### Approach 1:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        //Initializing the right pointer as the largest 
        //value in piles
        int left = 1;
        int max = 1;
        int right = 1;
        for(int pile: piles) {
            if(pile > max) {
                max = pile;
            }
        }
        right = max;

        //start binary search in the possible Ks: [1, 2, ... max[piles]]
        int mid = 0;
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while(left <= right) {
            mid = left + ((right - left) / 2);
            int hours = 0;
            for(int pile : piles) {
                hours += Math.ceil((double)pile / mid);
            }

            if(hours <= h) {
                res = Math.min(res, mid);
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

**Reflection:**

*Self-Note:*

*Some of the visualizations are on my notability notes.*

Possible k values should be ranging from *1 to the max # of bananas in piles*, denoted as *1 to max[piles]*

For example, piles = [3, 6, 7, 11], then all possible k should be [1, 2, 3, ... , 11] （因为最小的时间是4小时，最大的速率是11，我们想找到尽可能小的速率，所以需要在1到11之间进行binary search）

Therefore, we could implement binary search from 1 to 11:

Iterate through all possible numbers in piles and take the ceiling from the division to get the total hours: **i.e Math.ceil(piles[i] / k[i])**

Add all hours together and check **if hours <= h:**

This k works! And we wanna *search to the left* to find out if there exists a smaller k that also works.

Also update hours to the current min k : Math.max(res, k)

**If hours > h:**

Means we went over the hours, means k is too small and we should *search to the right* (move the left pointer to mid + 1)

When L and R crossed out, meaning the searching has done, then we return the current minimum k.

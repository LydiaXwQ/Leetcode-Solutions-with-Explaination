# 704. Binary Search

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

> Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
> Output: 4
> Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4.

Some general facts:

In order for binary search to be practical, we need to have the array is **sorted**. Or in other words, if you see a **sorted array**, you can consider about using **Binary Search**.

For this question, we do three steps:

1. Find mid index: **mid = left + (right - left) / 2** (this is for avoiding **Integer Overflow**)

2. Check if nums[mid] is greater than or smaller to the target:
3. If nums[mid] > target : It means our target should be in the smaller side. Thus, we should search left. In code, we could write : right = mid;

4. Otherwise, if nums[mid] < target : It means our target should be in the greater side. Thus, we should search right. In code, we write: left = mid;

eg. [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&nbsp;^

Since 9 > 5, we search right. (left = mid)

5. Continue to do this, until left and right are together.

```
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;


        while(left + 1 < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if(nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
                right = mid;
                //if nums[mid] == mid:
            } else {
                return mid;
            }
        }

        if(nums[left] == target) {
            return left;
        } else if (nums[right] == target) {
            return right;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
```

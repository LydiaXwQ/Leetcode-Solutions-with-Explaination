## 20. Valid Parentheses

#### Question

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.



#### Approach 1: Stack

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        Map<Character, Character> map = Map.of('(', ')',
                                        '{', '}',
                                        '[', ']' );
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char curr = s.charAt(i);
            //if map contains key, meaning curr is a open brace
            if(map.containsKey(curr)) {
                //push opening brace onto the stack
                stack.push(curr);
            } else {
                //if curr is a closing brace:

                if(stack.isEmpty()) {
                    return false;
                }
                //then we want to see if the most recent (top) of the stack is 
                //same type of the closing brace
                if(map.get(stack.peek()).equals(curr)) {
                    stack.pop();
                } else {
                    return false;
                }

            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

**Reflection:**

Traverse the String, when meeting an opening brace, push it onto the stack. 

When meeting a closing brace, check if the brace at the top of the stack with of the same type of the closing brace.

If it is, then pop brace off. Otherwise, return false.

There's two edge case:

  1. If meet a closing curly brace, if the stack is empty, return false directly (there's no opening brace 			match with the closing one)

  2. In the final return statement, we should return stack.isEmpty(); instead of true to avoid this kind of case: s = "("

     Since when only there's one opening brace, the stack will only contain this brace, then it will never enter the closing-check to return false as no element left in s.

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n)

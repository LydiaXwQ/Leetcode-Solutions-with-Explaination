## 155. Min Stack

#### Question: 

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.



#### Approach 1: Two Stacks

```java
class MinStack {
    private Stack<Integer> stack;
    private Stack<Integer> minStack;

    public MinStack() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
        minStack = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    public void push(int val) {
        if(stack.isEmpty()) {
            stack.push(val);
            minStack.push(val);
        } else {
            stack.push(val);
            int minVal = Math.min(stack.peek(), minStack.peek());
            minStack.push(minVal);
        }
    }
    
    public void pop() {
        stack.pop();
        minStack.pop();
    }
    
    public int top() {
        return stack.peek();
    }
    
    public int getMin() {
        return minStack.peek();
    }
}
```

**Reflection:**

Tricky part is how to handle the getMin() function. So we can use 2 stacks, one is our main stack, and the other keep tracks of the current min at each element (the minStack).

For example, when there's no elements (i.e stack is empty), the curr Min is the only element in the stack (i.e -2). So we have   if(stack.isEmpty()) {
            stack.push(val);
            minStack.push(val);
  }

If there's more than one element (i.e stack is not empty), then the curr Min is min (minStack.peek(), stack.peek()). (i.e at the new pushing 0, the currMin is min(0, -2)). 

Thus, when we getMin(), we can basically just return the minStack.peek();

Since we only compare 2 elements each time, the time complexity is **`O(1)`**, and space complexity is **`O(n)`**.
